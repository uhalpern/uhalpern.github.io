<p>The period of my life post high school when I was choosing what I wanted to do for the rest of my life was a tumultuous time. It was fun searching for potential college majors that peaked my interest but making that final decision to commit was like taking the first step onto a path of uncertainty. I chose computer science on a whim. I had no previous programming experience throughout high school but had researched the potential careers, and it seemed like a safe bet. Eventually, I would come to discover that the path ahead of me was one that I wanted to stay on.</p>

<h2 id="training-phase">Training Phase</h2>
<hr />

<p>After I finally committed to majoring in computer science, I began learning the basics of programming with online classes and was exposed to the wide variety of things you can do with coding. The simple concepts were introduced to me and I made some small projects like a Tic-Tac-Toe game and Blackjack. However, there was still no epiphany or realization moment that made me confident I had chosen the right career path. It was not until I took an intro level python course during my first college semester that I started to become hooked.</p>

<p>They say behind every great student was a professor who believed in their potential. I would say that I was incredibly lucky to be taught by Dr. Travis Mandel, the professor for my intro level python class. I am sure all professors are passionate about their field of study but from Travis, I felt as if he was just as enthusiastic for his job to teach. His class was insightful and rewarding as the material showed me a dozen different ways that each new coding technique could be applied for data analysis. After this class with him, I was lucky enough to be chosen for his research team in which I worked directly with developing A.I. to answer important questions about the future of machine learning and human teamwork. It was after this direct exposure to the applications of computer science, along with the support of a professor that had confidence in me, that I finally discovered the determination to embrace this career path.</p>

<h2 id="a-look-towards-the-future">A Look Towards the Future</h2>
<hr />

<p>Since machine learning can be utilized in so many different fields, I want to continue to discover which areas I enjoy the most. Although I have some experience under my belt, artificial intelligence is constantly evolving to fit the needs of today and the future. I hope that I can continue to accumulate design and testing skills that I can eventually apply to my own projects. One thing that I can be sure of is that I am on the right track and that I can succeed in what I am doing.</p>
