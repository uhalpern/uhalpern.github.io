The Data Driven Agriculture initiative is a Summer Undergraduate Research Internship focusing on interdisciplinary skills in plant science and computer science.

In the summer of 2024, I had the pleasure of participating in this program. Over the course of 9 weeks, my cohort and I oversaw the growth, measurement, and analysis of over 250 maize plants of various genotypes. Throughout the process, I contributed by developing scripts to ease the data collection process through the automatic detection of harvest ready plants based on past growth data. 

For the second part of the experience, I co-led a research initiative with another cohort member that utilized statistical tests and machine learning to compare the discrimination ability of maize root traits and shoot traits. The program culminated in a symposium in which our results were communicated to a broader scientific audience.
